# Honkai: Star Rail Team Randomizer
Herta's Simulated Team Randomizer (HSTR) is an Honkai: Star Rail team randomizer that generates randomized teams based on the characters that you own. Challenge yourself with a randomized team in your Simulated/Divergent Universe, Memory of Chaos, Pure Fiction, or Apocalyptic Shadow runs!

## About the Project
This project is my first-ever website! I tried starting with the basics so this website only uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was inspired by [Genshin Impact Team Randomizer](https://genshin-impact-team-randomizer.pages.dev/) and there wasn't any HSR equivalent to it, so I decided to make one myself. It will be quickly updated whenever new characters come out.
